# Computer Vision

This repository contains my work from a computer vision course that I chose to study independently to explore my interest in how machines interpret and analyse visual data. The course built my understanding of fundamental computer vision concepts and applied techniques using Python and OpenCV.

## Why I Took This Course

I undertook this course out of personal interest, wanting to deepen my understanding of how image-based data can be processed and analysed. It complemented my existing work in neural networks and data science and helped me explore potential applications in areas like wildfire detection and medical imaging.

## Topics Covered

### Image Transformations
- RGB, grayscale, and color space conversions
- Affine and projective transformations (Homography)
- Manual panorama stitching using DLT

### Filtering & Morphology
- Smoothing, sharpening, and edge detection (Canny)
- Gaussian filters, gradients
- Morphological operations: dilation, erosion, skeletonization

### Shape Detection
- Line and circle detection using RANSAC & Hough Transform
- Parametric and non-parametric shape detection

### Keypoint Detection
- Harris corners, multi-scale detection
- SIFT features, feature matching, panorama building

### Motion & Object Tracking
- Optical flow (Lucasâ€“Kanade), motion segmentation
- Histogram-based and KLT tracking

### Object Detection
- Classical approaches (sliding windows, scale/rotation handling)
- Discussion of limitations and trade-offs

## Tools
- Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Jupyter

This work gave me a practical foundation in image processing and reinforced my interest in applying data science techniques to visual and real-world problems.
